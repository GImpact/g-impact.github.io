## Research Interests
My research interests include climate change, AI modeling, climate extremes, and subseasonal-to-seasonal prediction. I'm currently focused on studying temperature extremes, particularly heat waves, and their predictability associated with intra-seasonal oscillations using AI weather models. I'm also interested in exploring the impacts of climate extremes on people and society.
