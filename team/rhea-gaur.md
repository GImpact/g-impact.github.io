## Research Interests

My research focuses on extreme events like cyclones, cyclones, floods, and more. I am interested in using statistical methods to understand the change in frequency and intensity of extreme events in a warming world. Furthermore, I want to explore the interconnected nature between these disasters and the impact they could have on life on Earth.
