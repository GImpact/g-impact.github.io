## Research Interests

My currrent research focuses on understanding the seasonal to multi-year predictability of climate extremes, particularly marine and terrestrial heatwaves. I am also interested in the potential impacts of extreme heat on human health. Another key aspect of my work involves studying the dynamics and future changes in extratropical cyclones, as well as wind and precipitation extremes, with plans to include state-of-the-art climate models and AI in future studies.
