## Seasonal to Multi-year Predictability of Marine Heat Waves

**Summary:**  

<div align="justify">Marine heat waves (MHWs) are a dominant threat to marine ecosystems, fisheries, and coastal communities. Estimating predictability and improving predictions of the frequency, intensity, and duration of these extremes on seasonal to multi-year time scales is crucial for proactive planning and adaptation. Here we use a large ensemble of uninitialized simulations, assimilations, and 5-year hindcasts initiated from every January 1st with the Community Earth System Model version 2 to assess the predictability and prediction skills of MHW statistics from 1981 to 2020.</div>

## Multi-year Predictability of Terrestrial Heat Waves in Global Hotspot Regions

**Summary:**  

<div align="justify">Terrestrial heatwaves (THWs) pose significant risks to ecosystems, human health, and socio-economies. However, predicting THW statistics (e.g., frequency) over practical multi-year time scales remains challenging due to the complex interactions between internal climate variability, large-scale climate drivers, and local processes. Using a large ensemble of uninitialized simulations, assimilations, and hindcasts from the Community Earth System Model version 2, we assess the predictability and prediction skill of THWs in global hotspot regions with lead times of up to 5 years initiated every January from 1981 to 2020.</div>
