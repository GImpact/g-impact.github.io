## Extreme Events and their Socio-Economic Impacts

**Summary:**

As global temperatures rise, extreme weather and climate events become increasingly frequent and severe. These events post significant risks to socio-economic systems, impacting economic growth, infrastructure, habitable areas and more, necessitating a deeper understanding of their economic implications. Using the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT), observational and model climate data, alongisde subnational economic data, we assess the global economic consequences of climate extremes in a granular fashion.

## Future Changes in Single and Clustered Cyclones Associated with Wind and Precipiation Extremes in the South Pacific

**Summary:**

<div align="justify">Extratropical cyclones in the Southern Hemisphere cause severe weather events, including heavy rainfall, floods, and storm surges, which may be exacerbated by anthropogenic climate change. However, the future impact of clustered wind and precipitation extremes associated with single or sequences of storms is still unknown and thus needs to be urgently quantified. Using the new 50-member MPI Grand Ensemble (MPI-GE) with 3-hourly model output for 5 different emissions scenarios, we systematically assess future single and clustered cyclones and examine trends, spatial and temporal clustering of wind and precipitation extremes in the South Pacific and adjacent lands.</div>
